Hello,
Thanks for downloading one of my pixel arts!

This tileset contains 14 unique blocks.
Also contains one Tree, Bush & Stone
Everything is for free :)

The file contains PNGs. 
(You can edit or adjust the sets however you feel like)

Set:
14 Unique Blocks
3x3 Inner Corner Grid
3x3 Outer Corner Grid
3x1 Block Grid
Tree
Bush
Stone

This is one of my first pixel art projects and I decided to share it with everyone 
and also see my progress and growth over time as I'll upload more and more

Do not claim it as your own or do not sell it!

Enjoy! :)
